# High Fidelity Wireframes

**Description of the Project**

I attempted to redesign the TechCrunch website to make it easier to use and more valuable to users. The purpose of this website is to provide people with the latest news in the realm of technology and business and provide people with the ability to learn and stay informed.
The purpose of these high fidelity wireframes is to visualize new features like categorization of articles under tech topics and saving articles to a personal library.I went through several rounds of iterations and kept asking users around me for feedback to improve upon my designs. The prototype submitted provides users to do the following tasks:

***Tasks***
1. View News of the Day articles quickly as soon as one opens the site
2. Search for articles through systematic categorization. Ex: View all Attificial Intelligence articles in one place
3. Save or bookmark articles to a personal library where the user can view all their saved content (even in catrgories)
4. (EXTRA TASK) Subscribe to newsletters of the user's choice

**Representative Screen Designs**

**Graphical User Interface Design Choices**

***Icons***
I used icons from the Material Design UI kit in order to maintain a clean consistency across the websit. Some of the key icons I made use of included chevrons, notifications, Bookmark, search, and filter. The benefits of using an established UI kit were that it maintained consistency, and used icons that people are already familiar with, making it easy to recognize calls to action. 

***Typography***
I wanted the font to be easy on the eyes because this is such a text heavy website. I tested several fonts with users through a survey to see which felt easy to read while looking good aesthetically Reading articles with serif fonts. 64% of users picked Roboto and so that's what I chose as my sites main font.

***Colors***
I did not want to stray from the TechCrunch color of green. Green respresents freshness, growth, progress, and energy - all important aspects of technologicall advancements. So I picked several varieties of green and picked the one that permormed best with accessibility checks.
