# high-fidelity-wireframes

** Description of the Project**
I attempted to redesign the TechCrunch website to make it easier to use and more valuable to users. The purpose of this website is to provide people with the latest news in the realm of technology and business and provide people with the ability to learn and stay informed.
The purpose of these high fidelity wireframes is to visualize new features like categorization of articles under tech topics and saving articles to a personal library.I went through several rounds of iterations and kept asking users around me for feedback to improve upon my designs. The prototype submitted provides users to do the following tasks:

***Tasks***
1. View News of the Day articles quickly as soon as one opens the site
2. Search for articles through systematic categorization. Ex: View all Attificial Intelligence articles in one place
3. Save or bookmark articles to a personal library where the user can view all their saved content (even in catrgories)
4. (EXTRA TASK) Subscribe to newsletters of the user's choice
